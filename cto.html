			I've built <a href="/about">eight SaaS products since 2008</a>, and I enjoy
			this type of software. That's why I'm offering my development
			services, but more specifically, as CTO to hire.
		</p>
		<p>
			It's difficult for a non-technical founder to find a good developer. I'm 
			experienced, and will help you build your v1.

		<h3>How does it work?</h3>
		<p>
			Schedule your 
			<a href="" onclick="Calendly.initPopupWidget({url: 'https://calendly.com/dominicstpierre/cto'});return false;">
				initial meeting here
			</a>. We'll talk about your product idea, and outline some first steps.
		</p>
		<p>
			In that discussion, I will be able to tell you if I can help you and
			roughly how many months it will take to reach your first version.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once we have a basic agreement, you may purchase the subscription. Note
			that the product price is set at $18,000 to make sure there are enough
			months to cover all scenarios. If your project takes three months,
			you'll cancel the subscription after that three months.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-8 w-full lg:w-1/2">
		<h3>Who owns what?</h3>
		<p>
			You own everything created. You have all the intellectual property of the 
			product. Since payments are in advance, I'm working directly on your 
			GitHub repository, and you may cancel at any time.
		</p>
		<p>
			You won't give up any equity, and you're in control of all assets.
		</p>
		<p>
			It's a productized service I'm offering because I've built lots of SaaS 
			in more than ten years. I have lots of common SaaS components ready to go.

<div class="pt-20 lg:flex">
	<div class="p-8 w-full lg:w-1/2">
		<h3>What can you expect?</h3>
		<p>
			A working product that handles the functionalities we agreed on and
			everything you need to be operational.
		</p>
		<p>
			You'll be able to accept payments, have a polished user onboarding,
			transactional emails, and an admin dashboard to monitor and manage
			different aspects of the product.
		</p>
		<p>
			The product is deployed on an infrastructure we discussed. Each product
			is different, and sometimes, to make sure we can reach the deadline, we
			need to adjust the infrastructure.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-8 w-full lg:w-1/2">
		<h3>What if you need a new feature?</h3>
		<p>
			I'm happy to help you maintain the product. There will be a $1,000 per
			month subscription that includes monitoring, bug fixing, and lite new
			feature development each month.
		</p>
		<p>
			This service makes sure your product runs smoothly during Montreal's
			business hours.
		</p>
		<p>
			The bottom line is that you're not left alone once your product is ready.
			I'm choosing to offer this service because I like small products and hope
			to build long-term relationships.

		<h3>How many hours per week?</h3>
		<p>
			It's not a per-hour agreement. It's more like you're getting an
			experienced programmer with 20 years of professional development
			and 10 years building SaaS for a very affordable price.
		</p>
		<p>
			For the building phase, I'm planning on focusing on only one customer
			at a time. You can expect 12 to 18 hours per week. We can have
			discussions via Slack, and we can schedule meetings during the
			business hour in the EDT time zone.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-8 w-full lg:w-1/2">
		<h3>What will I not do?</h3>
		<p>
			Anything illegal, anything I feel is not the right fit for me for any
			reason.
		</p>
		<p>
			Anything related to design as in logo, images, and eye-candy visuals.
			You might want to plan to have a designer for anything you want to be
			"beautiful."
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm also not going to build anything using Ruby on Rails. If it's a
			requirement of yours, we save both our time here.
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm also not doing any native iOS and Android development. I build
			mobile-friendly web applications but no native mobile development.
