I enjoy sharing knowledge and talking about what I'm learning. I try to create 
as much content as I can. Those are the courses I've published. If you're 
looking for straightforward online courses, you may have a look.

**[Build SaaS apps in Go (2nd edition)](https://buildsaasappingo.com/)**: Learn 
how to build a Go web API server with specific opinions regarding building a 
software-as-a-service (SaaS).

The course lets you build your web engine, making sure you master all the 
building blocks and concepts of any web application.
