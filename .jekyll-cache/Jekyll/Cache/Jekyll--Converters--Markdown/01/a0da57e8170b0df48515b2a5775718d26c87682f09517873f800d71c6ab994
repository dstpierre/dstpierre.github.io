<p>probably be more easy to confirm. Here’s what I’ve done in the last years in
terms of SaaS.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/congrats-saas.png" alt="List of SaaS I built" /></p>

<p>Looking at this table it’s almost easy to say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well, maybe if you had continued one product more than 1.5 year you would have
been more successful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe, but it’s excruciably hard to pursue a venture when there’s not much<br />
revenue and low number of customers thrilled to use your software. I have no
regrets though, I’ve learned a lot and took paths that I will never revisit<br />
again. I’m not that <strong>attracted to SaaS anymore</strong>, maybe I’m not fit to have<br />
that kind of software business, maybe the niches and markets were too crowded.</p>

<p>No matter what, I’m now returning to what I always loved and were excited to do
— more on that later.</p>

<h3 id="what-worked">What worked</h3>

<p>This is some marketing tasks I’ve done that worked for me and if you did not<br />
tried them you might want to give them a shot.</p>

<p><strong>30 minutes 1-on-1 consulting for new customers.</strong> It’s part of having a great
onboarding experiences for your new customers. Having an easy to follow product
tour or some training are good and you should put efforts to polish those. But
offering a 1-on-1 30 minutes Skype call to your new customers **WILL **most
certainly boost your conversion rates instantly.</p>

<p>From August 2013 to October 2013 I’ve been able to double the revenue of my SaaS
using that technique. It’s ultra time consuming I’ll give you that, but the
information you get showing your app to a new customers is gold.</p>

<p>Getting their feedback live and seeing where they are blocking and unsure about
what to do next or how to do things is the key to enhance your UX.</p>

<p>Try this out and let me know the results.</p>

<p><strong>Third party integration.</strong> I’m a huge fan of the Open Web. With Bunker and
Osmosis I created an API and put efforts to connect the app with other software
that would bring more values to my customers if they were to use the other apps.
Exchanging data is a great way to save time for your customers. Doing the hard
work for them can be a valid selling point.</p>

<p>With Osmosis I went one step further and I’ve integrated the app with almost any
third-party software that existing customers were requesting. I’ve<br /> contacted
those software companies to let them know about the integration and they
sometimes add your app on their add-ons or externals apps page.</p>

<p>The traffic coming from those links is really good since those visitors are<br />
already using the other app and should see the benefits of connecting your app
with their current account.</p>

<p>You can also connect to <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> and get instant access
to<br /> nearly 200 other apps that are ready to exchange data with your app. I
really<br /> enjoyed doing the Zapier integration and literally fall in love with
the way<br /> they handle all the connection between apps and all the
interactions.</p>

<p><strong>Guest post, but high value legit content.</strong> I’m not even sure it can be called
a guest post. Writing high value content on a popular blog that fit your
targeted audience but without necessarily trying to sell your product on the
article. Plan on writing at least 3–4 posts on the same blog to get the best
result possible. Have a signature that point to your product’s website.</p>

<p>There’s no magic here, people are tired of always be presented with articles<br />
that are clearly written to sell a product. You’re better trying to get
trust<br /> from the readers and they will check the product via your signature if
they<br /> find your articles interesting.</p>

<p>You can have some links referencing content on your own product’s blog, but
keeping the article focused on giving the highest possible value for the<br />
readers is, in my opinion, the best way to approach writing for another popular
blog. With Osmosis I did this and the traffic that came from those articles were
pretty good leads.</p>

<p><strong>Manually contacting potential customers.</strong> Now I’m not saying creating a one
or two template email and sending it to everyone on your market. For three weeks
I’ve tried this and it worked surprisingly well although it took a huge amount
of hours from my busy schedule. I couldn’t have done this for much longer
without lowering the number of prospects I was contacting per day.</p>

<p>The idea is to search for potential customers, real businesses that would be<br />
interested and would benefits from using your product. Take some times on<br />
their website, Twitter stream and maybe Facebook to see if you could connect
with them regarding something they’ve posted recently. Yeah, I know it’s sound
crazy, you often search for 15–25 minutes and you craft a super personalized
email starting with the topic that you’ve found.</p>

<p>As everyone is telling these days, make sure you focus on the <strong>YOU</strong> of<br />
course and keep it short. You can ask them to try your product because you<br />
thought it would solve X problems for them. You give a direct link to you<br />
sign-up page.</p>

<p>It’s working and often the business will reply with valuable feedback or
just<br /> to get in touch. I was contacting nearly 10 new businesses/consultant
per day, hence I did not continued after three weeks. It is the most time
consuming approach and I’m not even sure I would try it again, but it’s an
alternative to Adwords and other ads services. You get the customers directly
instead of them finding you. A long and tough process, but it can work.</p>

<p><strong>Extreme support</strong>. I have this mindset since I’ve started Twollow. Giving the
best support and customer services I can so no one will ever say: “Well, it’s a
one man operation, support must be slow and product would not move fast enough.”</p>

<p>A part from Bunker, I always use my own in-app support and ticket system. Before
you say anything, no it’s not that long to write those things, and yes<br /> I had
fun doing this. It’s true that you need to focus on important things,<br /> but if
you do not do what you are thrilled to do you might not be able to<br /> continue.</p>

<p>My response time was in average less than 12 hours (mostly less than 4 horus)
which is good for a one main operation. heck you get 24–48 hours from larger
companies. While giving solid support your customers should put more trust in
you. It’s also the best time to request for a testimonial. As soon as a
situation was fixed and the customer replied with email like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thank you very much for your quick support you’ve made my day…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You reply back and ask if they would accept to give you a short Twitter style
testimonial. You should get it 75 % of the time.</p>

<p><strong>AB testing.</strong> You should do this, <em>now</em>. Even if your traffic is not that high
do it. If Patrick <a href="https://training.kalzumeus.com/newsletters/archive/why_you_do_not_ab_test">says you
should</a>,
you should.</p>

<p><strong>Try to get reviewed on popular site.</strong> It’s not <strong>easy</strong>, but it is worth
trying. Getting a review on <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5845119/bunker-app-is-a-super-simple-project-tracker-and-invoice-generator-for-freelancers">Life Hacker for
Bunker</a>
bring a huge amount of traffic and a nice percentage of them open an account.
It’s usually not the greatest converting traffic, but the words is spreading.</p>

<p>Don’t be afraid to contact the site editors if they’ve already made a review
of<br /> your product and your product did change a lots since then. They might
be<br /> interested in doing a follow-up review.</p>

<p><strong>Fix and iterate quickly and send newsletters.</strong> The last thing that seems to
have work for me is the speed at which I was fixing bugs and iterate the
software to get incremental small additions. I was normally pushing new version
in production each week or two week. Sometimes it was very small changes barely
noticeable. For major update I was always teasing the customers and free trial
users that did not converted with a newsletter.</p>

<p>User that did not converted were interested in the product, they might not have
converted because it was missing something or the timing was not good. By
sending newsletters to your entire user base you make sure that a) everyone is
aware of what’s going on and b) you notify the trial users that new feature are
coming. It might just be the feature that they were looking for.</p>

<p>Every time I’ve sent a newsletter for each product I always got a nice boost<br />
in traffic and some users were re-opening their account to check the new<br />
features and how the app is now more complete than when they’ve previously tried
it.</p>

<h3 id="what-did-not-worked">What did not worked</h3>

<p>Again, I’m just listing things that did not worked for <em>my situation</em>, I’m
not<br /> saying that it will not work for you.</p>

<p><strong>Press release.</strong> Now before you mention something about my poor English
writing style, note that I’ve hired someone to write the PR. In case you are
curious, <a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2012/5/prweb9460386.htm">here’s the
article</a>. The action of
submitting a press release and getting other sources to re-publish the article
do work. But the small burst of traffic that it sent me and the quality was the
aspect that did not work. I’m not remembering the exact price for the writer but
it was near $1K plus the fees from PRWeb.</p>

<p>The first 24 hours it brings some nice traffic, but from day 2 and until day
5<br /> the traffic was just degrading rapidly. After 5 days I never got anything
from<br /> this. So I nearly puts $1.5k in this with not much results.</p>

<p><strong>Hiring a mentor to help you.</strong> Don’t get me wrong, I acknowledge that there’s
mentors that will help you reach another level. I’ve hire three persons which
are known in our community to look at my products. Two for Bunker and one for
Osmosis.</p>

<p>In all three consultation I’ve invested around $4.5k. Now this is a truck
load<br /> of money for me since my product’s revenue was not even covering for
hosting and other 3rd parties services. Still I needed to try that and see if I
were doing something really wrong. Why my conversion rates was that low? How to
increase the quality of my traffic and get targeted visitors?</p>

<p>I’ve got some nice hints here and there, but nothing actually made any<br />
difference. After a consultation you normally have a series of tasks to<br />
complete from which the mentors gave you from their experiences and they<br />
should work. It didn’t work for me. Maybe it’s not something that can occurs<br />
in one session, but I was certainly not rich enough to afford having them
for<br /> another session.</p>

<p>The lessons I’ve learn is, trust yourself. You own the product, you know
what<br /> is your best targeted potential customers, just go and keep trying. I
could<br /> have put that money somewhere else and would have had better result,
who<br /> knows.</p>

<p>And note that I’m not talking about outsourcing part of your process to help<br />
get things done fast. This is recommended. I’m talking about paying a known
person ~$1.5k so they can look at your product and give you recommendations and
direction to take. I don’t want to name anyone here, it was my decisions to take
these route, but I will never do this again.</p>

<p><strong>No enthusiast after 8–9 months for poor revenue product.</strong> For <em>all</em> of my
products the first two months are so intense, so fun. And I’m not necessarily
talking about development. After some months without noticeable results you
start to be frustrated and despaired. Why me? Why everyone else is succeeding? I
only had a $1k per month revenue goal, how come I’m not there yet and only have
$80/month?</p>

<p>Software as a Service is a slow process. The slow ramp of death they say.<br />
Yeah, I know that, but still, only $200/month revenue after 1-year! How am I
supposed to get enthusiast about a product that barely starts to pay for<br />
itself. That mean no profit yet. I’m not that strong to do this. This is<br />
probably my biggest problem and I know it. What if I had waited another year,
maybe the revenue would have quadruple? Maybe, but it’s too much for me.</p>

<p>It’s not easy to keep continuing and especially when you got some external<br />
critical situation. Working on your product take lots of your family and<br />
consulting time. If something bad happen it’s harder to keep going with this<br />
non-revenue product. I had a surgery on September 30th and that’s mainly why
I’ve sold Osmosis.</p>

<p>You never know what the future is, and you never know if you would be better
quitting a product and starting again, or keep going when the revenue is that
low.</p>

<h3 id="low-or-no-impact-tasks">Low or no impact tasks</h3>

<p>These things did not have a huge impact on my results, but I would still retry
them for another product and try to get better at it.</p>

<p><strong>Content marketing.</strong> How to attack this when you start or do not have that
much revenue to completely outsource the writing of great content for your
target audience? For Osmosis I hired a professional writer that was writing once
a month a solid post that would give value to the readers without trying to sell
Osmosis. I wanted to have a point of entry to the site and once the trust would
be established try to make them try the software if they were having the problem
it solved.</p>

<p>I would guess that I would have needed 1 article per week to have better<br />
results with this. But at 1 per month it was simply not worth the money<br />
invested in the short terms. Adding quality content is always important and<br />
that’s why I continued. The goal were to provide Google with a solid article<br />
made for the readers. It was not targeting any specifics keywords, we were<br />
deciding the topic together and the article was not specially written for SEO.</p>

<p>If you have great writing skills you can certainly do this without having to<br />
hire someone. Still it is time consuming to write a quality article and even<br />
more for an epic post. Once you have an established audience it’s easier to<br />
connect with them and let them know about your product or just continue to
provide solid content and the words is spreading. This is a long process but is
certainly rewarding when done right. Make sure you are getting their email
address.</p>

<p><strong>Social media.</strong> The three mentors from which I was speaking earlier all
advised on not putting any time at all on social media. For me it sounded not
right, maybe they are correct in the assumption that it would probably not be
your main traffic source and no one might ever convert from this channel. But
ask yourself, when you checked at a business’s Twitter account and see that
their last tweet was from 1 year ago what do you say? Be honest, we say: “Crap,
they are not very active.”</p>

<p>The way I used Twitter, Facebook, Google+ and LinkedIn was mainly to post<br />
related articles as often as I could. But it was not that often.</p>

<p>Twitter can be a good place to connect with prospects if you are not too<br />
aggressive. You can enter a discussion without ever saying a thing about your
product. They will find out one way or another. Either way, if you are<br />
planning on outsourcing that aspect. Make sure that the person who speaks for
your product / business knows how to properly react under your brand’s<br />
mindset.</p>

<p><strong>Ads.</strong> Depending on your market you might have great results with ads
campaign. The product that I’ve tried were in the freelancers / small agencies
web design, development market. It was costly to say the least to try and get
some keywords and key phrases that would bring traffic. I tried Google Ad words,
Facebook ads and BuySellAds.</p>

<p>I’m most certainly a complete newbie regarding Google Ad words. I mean, I<br />
never took the time to really put the most beneficial ads groups. Paying
$1–2<br /> per click starts to be on the expensive side I must admit. Your product
needs<br /> to have a good conversion rates to be able to pay that much. I never
had a<br /> good conversion rates for my paid SaaS. So those kinds of ads were not
really effective. I’ve played a bit with Google remarketing ads and those were
better than traditional ads.</p>

<p>Facebook ads helped to get likes on the product page, but were simply not good
for getting visitors. And even if it were, the landing page that I’ve used was
not a good fit for Facebook traffic. You would need a more social ready<br />
landing page when you get traffic from Facebook. I never took time to do such
thing.</p>

<p>The BuySellAds was OK I guess. Again not much traffic but since my conversion
rates always were low, you can bring 10k visitors and you still need to be good
at converting them to get money out of this. You have to carefully pick the
sites that will show your banner ads though. It’s worth taking sometimes and
reading couple of past articles from the site and just check the overall
business that are advertising there.</p>

<h3 id="going-for-my-enthusiast-this-time">Going for my enthusiast this time</h3>

<p>As an entrepreneur I cannot stay there without having projects ahead on me.<br />
But this time I will try something different. I will listen to my enthusiast.</p>

<p>One thing that I’ve learned with all my failures is that I better love what<br />
I’m doing, it’s the only way I will be able to keep continuing when rough time
occurs. I will go for something I’m passionate about. I will leave the<br />
Freelancer market to others…</p>

<p>If I’m not passionate enough I will end up closing the product or selling it
after 1 year like I did with all my products so far. I don’t want that. I’m
tired of abandoning and I simply want to have fun again doing what I enjoy the
most in life, developing and owning a software product.</p>
