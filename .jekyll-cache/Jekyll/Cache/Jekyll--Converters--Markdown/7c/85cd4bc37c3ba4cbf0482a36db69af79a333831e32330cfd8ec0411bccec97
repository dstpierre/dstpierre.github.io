  <p>Please note that this video was using the first beta version of SignalR, lots of things changes 
since that day.</p>

<p>SignalR is so exciting. I cannot think of how it could have been easier to
achieve that level of real-time communication in the past. Iâ€™ve started
<a href="http://livechatstarterkit.codeplex.com">LCSK</a> in 2007 and finding that kind
of energy and desire to complete the v2 after 5 year is only possible because
of the fun I have developing with SignalR.</p>

<p>Here is the second part of a series Iâ€™m currently doing on rewriting my open
source live chat / live help project. In the <a href="http://www.dominicstpierre.net/2012/11/signalr-and-livechat-starter-kit-
video.html">first
part</a> I cover the basic on how to plug SignalR into a project. The
second part demonstrate the agent panel in an acceptable stage where an agent
can sign-in, accept and answer to visitor and be notify when a visitor close
the chat.</p>
