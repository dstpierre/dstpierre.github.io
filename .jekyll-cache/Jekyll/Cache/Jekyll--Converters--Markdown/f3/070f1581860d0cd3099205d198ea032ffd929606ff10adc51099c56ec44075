  <p>Please note that this video was using the first beta version of SignalR, lots of things changes 
since that day.</p>

<p>The version 1.5 of <a href="http://livechatstarterkit.codeplex.com">LCSK</a> was not
doing a bad job in terms of presenting a relatively interesting experience to
the end user (visitor). I‚Äôve started from the same JavaScript file of that
version and simply changed the part where I was using continuous polling for
new messages and adding new message for SignalR server call and client
callback.</p>

<p>In almost a weekend I was able to craft a not so terrible live support
solution using SignalR. If you did not try it so far I highly encourage you to
check it out. Despite the fact that lots of SignalR demos are related to chat,
the possibility are just incredible and even for ‚Äúnon-sexy‚Äù line of business
data-entry apps.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve published an early <a href="http://livechatstarterkit.codeplex.com/releases/view/98077">alpha preview of the version
2</a> so you can play
with the code and see for yourself how <strong>amazing SignalR is.</strong></p>
