<p>What an announcement Microsoft did at the Build conference this morning. There has been lots of shocking announcements
to be honest.</p>

<h3 id="visual-studio-code-for-mac-osx-and-linux">Visual Studio Code for Mac OSX and Linux</h3>

<p>I was really intrigued to try this one out, a lightweight code editor with multiple languages supported and the
Visual Studio intellisense. Iâ€™ve installed it on my Arch Linux.</p>

<p>Just <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/Download">download</a> and unzip the file, itâ€™s an executing binary just started
it <code class="highlighter-rouge">./Code</code> and here it was.</p>

<h3 id="small-footprint-but-interesting-features">Small footprint but interesting features</h3>

<p>Iâ€™ve tried it very quickly for JavaScript and C# intellisense. Seems to be pretty good. And has theyâ€™ve said
itâ€™s not only auto-completion but really intellisense.</p>

<p>This is not a review in any case, but I just needed to try it out for myself.</p>

<p>Normally I use a combinasion of Atom, WebStorm, Vim, PyCharm and Visual Studio. This VSCode is worth investigating
where it can fit.</p>
