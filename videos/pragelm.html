			That's right, the superb functional frontend language you'll learn to
			love.
		</p>
		<p>
			Be warned you might have a hard time returning to JavaScript once you
			discover how fun and productive Elm is.
		</p>
		<p>
			Together we will build a complete web application. We are starting from
			scratch all to deployment. You'll learn everything you need to start your
			projects with Elm and be in control of the flow.

		<h3>Pre-requisites</h3>
		<p>
			No previous experience for Elm or functional programming is required.
		</p>
		<p>
			Ideally, you already have built a frontend web application with
			JavaScript or TypeScript. If you already have some experience with
			React, Angular, or Vue, that might help, but it's not at all required.
		</p>
		<p>
			You'll need a working Node and NPM environment and a good grasp on
			building a frontend web application in general.
		</p>
		<p>
			Also, make sure you read 
			<a href="https://guide.elm-lang.org/" target="_blank">the Elm guide</a> 
			before starting the course.

<div class="pt-20 lg:flex">
	<div class="p-8 w-full lg:w-1/2">
		<h3>Build a SPA in Elm</h3>
		<p>
			I'll teach you how to build a single-page application. One that you'll 
			have a good time maintaining without feeling the urge to rewrite it after 
			three years.
		</p>
		<p>
			Learning all about the SPA model will also give you the knowledge to 
			build a multi-page web application so you get the best of both worlds and 
			can apply the right paradigm based on the situation.

		<h3>JSON in&lt;-&gt;out and websocket</h3>
		<p>
			We will communicate with a fictive backend via HTTP requests and 
			WebSocket.
		</p>
		<p>
			We will cover JSON encoding and decoding in Elm. How creating the types 
			first helps design better frontend web applications.
		</p>
		<p>
			I'll show you how you can pass messages in and out of your application 
			using websocket and how you have to revert to using JavaScript for that.
		</p>

	<div class="p-8 w-full lg:w-1/2">
		<h3>Uploading file, drag &amp; drop, JavaScript ports</h3>
		<p>
			I'll cover how to embrace how Elm interacts with JavaScript and how you 
			can leverage your knowledge of JavaScript to perform key aspects of 
			typical web applications.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are some aspects that Elm is not supporting natively. Writing and 
			reading the local storage, for example. For that, you'll need to pass 
			messages via JavaScript ports.
		</p>
		<p>
			This last part makes sure the applications you build with Elm are not 
			limited in features due to Elm not supporting something you need in the 
			browser.
