			That's right, the superb functional frontend language you'll learn to
			love.
		</p>
		<p>
			Be warned you might have a hard time returning to JavaScript once you
			discover how fun and productive Elm is.
		</p>
		<p>
			Together we will build a complete web application. We are starting from
			scratch all to deployment. You'll learn everything you need to start your
			projects with Elm and be in control of the flow.

		<h3>Pre-requisites</h3>
		<p>
			No previous experience for Elm or functional programming is required.
		</p>
		<p>
			Ideally, you already have built a frontend web application with
			JavaScript or TypeScript. If you already have some experience with
			React, Angular, or Vue, that might help, but it's not at all required.
		</p>
		<p>
			You'll need a working Node and NPM environment and a good grasp on
			building a frontend web application in general.
		</p>
		<p>
			Also, make sure you read the Elm guide before starting the course.
