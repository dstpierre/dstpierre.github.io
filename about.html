Hey there, my name is Dominic St-Pierre. I'm a software engineer living in 
the middle of the wood north of Montreal, Qu√©bec, Canada.

since 2008 I'm building product for myself trying to find one that users will find useful and that I'll 
have a blast maintaining and growing.

The two last attempt were [LeadFuze](https://www.leadfuze.com) and [Roadmap](https://roadmap.space).

In September 2018 I publish [a book on Go and writing SaaS app](https://buildsaasappingo.com). It took me 11 months to write the book 
and the accompagning source code. It was pretty fun, but super hard.

### Need a reliable developer?

I'm doing consulting here and there, mostly depending on project. Contact me if you want to chat.
