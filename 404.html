<h2>GONE!</h2>

<p>
I just migrated my blog over to Jekyll from Medium.
</p>
<p>
I tried to keep the same URL scheme, but maybe one post was not properly
named. Let me know via Twitter - [@dominicstpierre](https://twitter.com/dominicstpierre)
I will have this fixed asap.
</p>

<h2>Here's the latest posts</h2>

<ul>
    {% for post in site.posts limit:12 %}
    <li class="post-item">
        <span class="meta"><time datetime="{{ post.date }}">
                {{ post.date | date_to_string }}
            </time></span>

        <a href="{{ post.url }}"><span>{{ post.title }}</span></a>
    </li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>
