I guess those things happen one day or another if you are not careful with
your backups. In short I’ve lost all my blog posts since the beginning of my
blogging starts on October 2007.

### What is ~300 blog posts anyway?

Sure compare to loosing important code files or entire client projects data
near a due date would have been much more disastrous. Still, for me, all those
blog posts were representing the fact that I was there since 2007. I
remembered having comments from some known folks from the .NET community etc.

### Fair enough, time to restart

I’ve lost the blog posts from a server transfer near September. I was sure I
had backed up and copied the SQL files from my SubText blog. Having all the
others important backup and web app transferred (except my blog), I’ve
cancelled my server with peace of mind. Two weeks after that I was finally
ready to restart my blog from the backup SQL file.

Oops, no file found. How come I’ve picked every other SQL backups and not my
blog. I guess those things happen when you are doing too much things at the
same time.

I will take that opportunity and try to re-established myself a bit.
