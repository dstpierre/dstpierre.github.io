The version 1.5 of [LCSK](http://livechatstarterkit.codeplex.com) was not
doing a bad job in terms of presenting a relatively interesting experience to
the end user (visitor). I’ve started from the same JavaScript file of that
version and simply changed the part where I was using continuous polling for
new messages and adding new message for SignalR server call and client
callback.

In almost a weekend I was able to craft a not so terrible live support
solution using SignalR. If you did not try it so far I highly encourage you to
check it out. Despite the fact that lots of SignalR demos are related to chat,
the possibility are just incredible and even for “non-sexy” line of business
data-entry apps.

I’ve published an early [alpha preview of the version
2](http://livechatstarterkit.codeplex.com/releases/view/98077) so you can play
with the code and see for yourself how **amazing SignalR is.**
