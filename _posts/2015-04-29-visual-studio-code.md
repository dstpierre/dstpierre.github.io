What an announcement Microsoft did at the Build conference this morning. There has been lots of shocking announcements
to be honest.

### Visual Studio Code for Mac OSX and Linux

I was really intrigued to try this one out, a lightweight code editor with multiple languages supported and the
Visual Studio intellisense. I’ve installed it on my Arch Linux.

Just [download](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) and unzip the file, it’s an executing binary just started
it `./Code` and here it was.

### Small footprint but interesting features

I’ve tried it very quickly for JavaScript and C# intellisense. Seems to be pretty good. And has they’ve said
it’s not only auto-completion but really intellisense.

This is not a review in any case, but I just needed to try it out for myself.

Normally I use a combinasion of Atom, WebStorm, Vim, PyCharm and Visual Studio. This VSCode is worth investigating
where it can fit.
