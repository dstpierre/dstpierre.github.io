This is the first post of a series on the rewrite of [LiveChat Starter
Kit](http://livechatstarterkit.codeplex.com) to version 2 using
[SignalR](http://signalr.net/) as the communication mechanism.

If you would like to join the project do not hesitate. Developing with SignalR
is a lot of fun I must say.
